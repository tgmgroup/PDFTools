          <h2>10. Commercial License Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By purchasing a commercial license for PDF Tools, you acknowledge
            and agree to the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>License Agreement:</strong> You have read and understood
              the
              <a href="licensing.html" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline"
                >Licensing Page</a
              >
              in its entirety before making your purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nature of License:</strong> You are purchasing a
              commercial license for PDF Tools's open-source code, which grants
              you the right to use the software in closed-source and proprietary
              environments without the obligations of the AGPL-3.0 license.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No License Key:</strong> PDF Tools does not use license
              keys. Upon purchase, you receive a ZIP archive containing the
              complete source code and binaries, identical to the publicly
              available open-source repository.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Refunds Policy:</strong>
              <strong class="text-red-400"
                >Under no circumstances shall a refund be made after
                purchase.</strong
              >
              All sales are final. By completing a purchase, you acknowledge
              that you have evaluated the software (which is freely available on
              GitHub) and are satisfied with its functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third-Party Components:</strong> The commercial license
              does not grant rights to use AGPL-licensed third-party components
              (such as CPDF, PyMuPDF, and Ghostscript) in a closed-source
              manner. You must comply with the AGPL v3 terms for these
              components or obtain separate commercial licenses from their
              respective vendors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unlimited Usage:</strong> The license permits use on an
              unrestricted, unlimited number of devices, servers, and user
              machines within your organization. There are no per-user,
              per-machine, or per-seat limitations.
            </li>
          </ul>
