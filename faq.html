              <strong>Absolutely.</strong> This is the most important feature of
              PDF Tools. All processing happens 100% locally in your web
              browser. Your files are never uploaded to any server, which means
              we—or anyone else—can never see them. Your privacy is guaranteed.

              Yes, it's completely free, and there's no catch. There are no
              hidden fees, no subscription plans, no usage limits, and no
              premium-only features. We believe essential tools should be
              accessible to everyone.

              After you load the website for the first time, most tools will
              work completely offline! Because all the processing libraries are
              loaded into your browser, you can disconnect from the internet and
              continue to merge, split, compress, and edit your PDFs securely.
              Some niche tools that require external data (like Markdown to PDF
              with web images) may need a connection.

              No, we do not impose any artificial limits on file size, the
              number of files, or how many times you can use a tool. The only
              practical limitation is the processing power and memory of your
              own computer, as very large or complex files may take longer to
              process.

              PDF Tools is built on the power of modern web technologies. We
              primarily use JavaScript libraries like
              <strong>PDF-lib.js</strong> and <strong>PDFKit.js</strong> that
              are compiled to run efficiently in your browser via WebAssembly.
              This allows for powerful, server-like processing without your data
              ever leaving your machine.
